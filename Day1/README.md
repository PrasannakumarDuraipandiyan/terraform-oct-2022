## What is Cloud Computing?
- Pay as you to Go pricing
- Flexible infrastucture that can used on demand
- Highly Available (HA)
- Dynamic scaling
- Cheaper than procurring and maintaining own Servers


## Why do we need Cloud Computing?
- to avoid infrastructure maintenance

## What is an Azure Region?
- you can think as a City like Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru

## What is an Azure Availability Zone?
- Within each Azure Region(City), there might be several Availability Zone
- Each Availability Zone represents one Data Center
- Eg: mumbai-west1a
      mumbai-west1b
      mumbai-west1c

## What is Data Centre
- a collection of many servers located in one Availability Zone under a Region
- Sever 1000s or even lakhs of Servers might be there in a single Availability Zone

## What is on-prem servers?
- On premise servers ( aka on-prem )
- Your company owned servers

## Different types of RAM
- UDIMM
- SODIMM
- RDIMM

## Multi socket Motherboards - Server Grade motherboards


## Integrated Chip 
- SCM ( Single Chip Module ) - One IC will have just One Processor ( 1 Processor per Socket )
- MCM ( Multiple Chip Module ) - One IC will have many Processors ( 1 IC may have 8 Processors )

## Multiple Cores
1 Processor - may have many numbers of CPU Cores

1 Processor - may have 256 core

MCM with 8 Processor ( Each Processor having 256 cores )
Per Socket = 8 x 256 Core =

Server Motherboardss that has 8 Sockets
MCM ( 1 IC with 8 Processors )
Each Processor having 256 Cores 

8 x 256 * 8 = 


## What are the deciding factors that control the number of Virtual Machines that can be supported by a Single Server/Desktop/Laptop?
- RAM (Memory )
- HDD/SDD (Storage)
- Number of Cores

Laptop Configuration
8 Cores, 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD(Storage)
How many maximum Virtual Machines(Guest OS) and Host OS you can run simultaneously ?
Host OS - 1
Guest OS - 7

Host OS - 1
Guest OS - ( 8 Physical Core x 2 Virtual Core - Each Physical core is seen as 2 Virtual Cores )

General Purpose Processors
1. AMD ( Invented 64 Bit Processors x86_64 Instructions )
 - 32 bit (AMD pays royalty for Intel's x86 Instructions set)
2. Intel (Invented 32 Bit Processors x86 Instructions )
 - 64 bit (Intel pays royalty for AMD's x64 Instruction set)
Virtualization Feature
AMD's virtualization feature
  - AMD-V (CPU Feature set)
Intel's Virtualization feature
  - VT-X (CPU Feature set)

Subnet (IP Block - Address Range)
172.17.0.0/16 (IPV4 IP Address - 32 bit wide(4 bytes))
A.B.C.D/16(Bit are Fixed from Left - 172 and 17 are fixed)
16 - CIDR

172 - 1 byte (8 bit)
17 - 1 byte (8 bit)
0 - 1 byte (8 bit)
0 - 1 byte (8 bit)

172.17.0.0
172.17.0.1
172.17.0.2
...
172.17.0.255
172.17.1.0
172.17.1.1
...
172.17.1.255
...
172.17.255.255

= 255 x 255 = 65536 IP Addresses are there in 172.17.0.0/16

172.17.0.0/24 ( 255 IP Adresses )
172.17.0.0
172.17.0.1
...
172.17.0.255






IPV4(exiting IP format) and IPV6(New type of IP)

IP Address can be Dynamic or Static IP
- Public and Private IP


Virtual Network or Network
- Each Network can be divided into many Subnets

Subnet 
- logical Network


## What is Private Cloud?
- Your on-prem data center

## What is Public Cloud?
- Azure
- AWS
- GCP

## Hybrdid Cloud
- Combination of your Private Cloud and Public Cloud

## OpenStack 
- you can manage virtual machine of different configurations on demand just like we can create VMs in Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.,
- Virtual Machines using the On-Prem Servers

## VMWare vSphare/vCenter (Bare Metal Hypervisor)

## What is Configuration Management Tools?
- Examples
  - Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- Infrastructure as a Code Tool
- Configuration Management Tools helps in automating software installation on a existing VMs, Physical Machine with OS
- For example, we can install a Webserver on a existing OS
- You can users on a existing OS

## What is a Provisioner tool?
- automation tools that can help in automating infrastructure
- can automate creating Virtual Machines(OS), Container, installing OS on a Physical Machine
- Example
   - HashiCorp Vagrant, Docker 
  
## What is an Orchestration Platform?
- container management platform
- manages containerized application/microservices
- Example
  - Google Kubernetes
  - RedHat OpenShift
  - Docker SWARM

## What is Cloudformation?

## What is Terraform?
- Infrastructure as a Code Tool
- primarily it helps in automating infrastructure (VMs, Storage, Load Balancers, etc )


You need a Virtual Machine with an CentOS 8 installed (Provisioner)
 - you could use Vagrant to provision Virtual Machine and automate CentOS 8 installation with SSH access based key pairs
 - Vagrant tools reads all the automation code from a script file called Vagrantfile ( ruby )
 - Developed by HashiCorp 

You wish to install Docker on that CentOS 8 Virtual Machine ( Configuration Management Tool)
- You could write ansible playbook to install Docker Container Engine

You wish to deploy a containerized Microservice ( Provisioner - IaC)
- You could use Docker

You wish to manage the microsevice (Orchestration Platform)
- Kubernetes/OpenShift to manage the containerized microservices

## What is Domanin Specific Language(DSL)?
- the language in which the automation code is written

Kubernetes/OpenShift
- it can be installed on your local Laptop/Desktop/Workstation/Server
- it can be installed in AWS/Azure/GCP on Virtual Machines on the public cloud
- Managed Services (SaaS - Model)
- In Azure
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - Managed Kubernetes Cluster (Orchestration Platform)
  - Installation of Kubernetes is taken care by Azure
- In AWS
  - Elatic Kubernetes Service (EKS) - Managed Kubernetes Cluster (Orchestration Platform)
- it provides an environment to run Microservices or Container applications
- it provides an environment for containerized application or microservice and make them High Available
- it is self-healing platform ( it know how to heal itself as well as microservice that are managed by them)
- it has inbuilt 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Only the hardware is rented from Public Cloud (AWS,Azure,GCP,IBM Cloud, VMWare Cloud,Oracle Cloud,etc)
- OS System Licenses are managed by us

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- We rent Hardware and Operating System from PUblic Cloud Vendors (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.,)
- We need install software like Oracle DB Server, Oracle Weblogic ourself either manually or in automated fashion

Software as a Service(SaaS)
- AWS EKS or Auzre AKS are examples

Infrastructure as a Code Tool
- helps in automation OS installation, softwares via source code
Examples:
1. Docker
2. Vagrant
3. Kubernetes/OpenShift/Docker SWARM
4. Ansible/Puppet/Chef/Salt(SaltStack)

## Creating a docker container using Terraform script

Create a folder named lab1 under your home directory
```
mkdir -p ~/terraform-oct-2022/Day1/lab1
cd ~/terraform-oct-2022/Day1/lab1
```

First create a file name 'main.tf' with the below content
<pre>
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
        source = "kreuzwerker/docker"
        version = "~> 2.13.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name = "nginx:latest"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
    image = docker_image.nginx.latest
    name = "my-nginx"
    ports {
        internal = 80
        external = 8080
    }
}
</pre>

Install the providers if it is not present on your local folder
```
cd ~/terraform-oct-2022/Day1/lab1
teraform init
```

Expected output
<pre>
jegan@tektutor:~/terraform-oct-2022/Day1/lab1$ <b>terraform init</b>

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding kreuzwerker/docker versions matching "~> 2.13.0"...
- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v2.13.0...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v2.13.0 (self-signed, key ID 24E54F214569A8A5)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
