## What is Cloud Computing?
- Pay as you to Go pricing
- Flexible infrastucture that can used on demand
- Highly Available (HA)
- Dynamic scaling
- Cheaper than procurring and maintaining own Servers


## Why do we need Cloud Computing?
- to avoid infrastructure maintenance

## What is an Azure Region?
- you can think as a City like Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru

## What is an Azure Availability Zone?
- Within each Azure Region(City), there might be several Availability Zone
- Each Availability Zone represents one Data Center
- Eg: mumbai-west1a
      mumbai-west1b
      mumbai-west1c

## What is Data Centre
- a collection of many servers located in one Availability Zone under a Region
- Sever 1000s or even lakhs of Servers might be there in a single Availability Zone

## What is on-prem servers?
- On premise servers ( aka on-prem )
- Your company owned servers


## Different types of RAM
- UDIMM
- SODIMM
- RDIMM

## Multi socket Motherboards - Server Grade motherboards


## Integrated Chip 
- SCM ( Single Chip Module ) - One IC will have just One Processor ( 1 Processor per Socket )
- MCM ( Multiple Chip Module ) - One IC will have many Processors ( 1 IC may have 8 Processors )

## Multiple Cores
1 Processor - may have many numbers of CPU Cores

1 Processor - may have 256 core

MCM with 8 Processor ( Each Processor having 256 cores )
Per Socket = 8 x 256 Core =

Server Motherboardss that has 8 Sockets
MCM ( 1 IC with 8 Processors )
Each Processor having 256 Cores 

8 x 256 * 8 = 


## What are the deciding factors that control the number of Virtual Machines that can be supported by a Single Server/Desktop/Laptop?
-
